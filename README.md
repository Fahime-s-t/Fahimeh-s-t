### 🚀 About Me

I’m a data enthusiast with 10+ years of experience in IT, data analysis, and software development across healthcare, education, and business environments. I love working with messy data, uncovering patterns, and presenting insights that help teams make better decisions.

My background spans data visualization, dashboard creation, SQL querying, data cleaning, and cross-functional collaboration. I also have hands-on experience in digital analytics and web design; which gives me a unique perspective when working with performance and behavior data.

When I’m not building dashboards or writing SQL queries, you can find me exploring the intersection of data, creativity, and business strategy.
